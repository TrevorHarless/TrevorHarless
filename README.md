- Hi, I’m @TrevorHarless, I love software engineering and working with users! Currently iterating on [Holiday Lights Pro](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/holiday-lights-pro/id6751132656) which is a tool to support holiday light installation companies in their quoting and customer management processes.
- I'm passionate about building software that makes people's lives easier.
